    <p><h1> Deborah Agosto </h1>
        <p> My name is Deborah and one of my favorite hobbies is learning about the Universe and everything inside of it! I love learning about the anomalies that universe holds from
            the mysteries behind black, white, and wormholes to also learning about the formation of stars, planets, nebulas, and even our island galaxies/universes, as well
            the infinity the rest beyond it. If the competition wasn't so high I would actually love to be a Software Engineer for a company like NASA, Space X, or even Blue Origin, maybe dreams can
            come true but with the compeition it's seems a bit bleak, However I'm still more than happy to explore other branches that can still fulfill my interests like military software enginerring,
            Machine Learning, web devlopments, etc. </p>

    <p>I always like to share 2 fun facts about the universe! </p>
    
    </p> Every living being on this Earth was derived from a Star. Stars are made up of 74% Hydrogen, 24% Helium, and the other 2% making up Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Carbon
    <p> Humans are made up of 65% Oxygen, 18% Carbon, 10% Hydrogen, and 3% Nitrogen leaving 1% for Calcium and Phosphorus. </p>
    
    <p>Our home Sun also fits 1.3,000,000 Earths inside of it!! </p>
